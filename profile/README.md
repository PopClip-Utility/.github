## About PopClip
PopClip is a unique and ingenious productivity utility that reimagines the simple act of selecting text. It adds a layer of instant, context-aware functionality that feels like a natural part of macOS. Whenever you highlight text—whether in a browser, a document, an email, or even a dialog box—PopClip's clean toolbar pops up, putting powerful one-tap actions at your fingertips. It eliminates the need to right-click, navigate through menus, or switch to another app to perform common tasks, creating a remarkably fluid and efficient workflow.

The true power of PopClip lies in its extensibility. While its built-in actions (copy, paste, open link, etc.) are useful, its thriving ecosystem of user-created extensions transforms it into a universal command center. You can add extensions to search selected text on GitHub, add a quote to Bear notes, convert units, or even run custom shell scripts. This makes PopClip infinitely adaptable to your personal workflow, whether you're a developer, writer, researcher, or project manager. It’s a small app that consistently saves seconds throughout the day, which adds up to significant time savings and reduced friction.
